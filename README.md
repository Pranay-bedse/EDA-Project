# EDA-Project.
* In this EDA Project we have to find:
1. Which city gives us the highest amount of profit. So that, we can establish new branch over there.
2. In which month of the year, in which day of the month, and in which time of the day(morning, afternoon, evening, night) we get the highest amount of profits.
3. Which product do we sell the most and which pair of products do we sell the most. So that, we can give some discount on that to increase over sales and profit.
